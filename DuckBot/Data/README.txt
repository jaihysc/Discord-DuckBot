Files used by the application should be stored here.

NOTE!!! - You will have to individually set the path for each file in the paths.exe in the execution directory of this application.


To change where the files are located, simply modify the paths for each file in paths.txt in the execution directory of this application.
The name of the files CAN NOT be changed, however their locations can.
